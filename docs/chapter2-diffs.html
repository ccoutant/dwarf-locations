<h2><span class="del">2.5 DWARF Expressions [Now Chapter 3]</span></h2>
<h2><span class="del">2.6 Location Descriptions [Now Chapter 3]</span></h2>
<h2><span class="add">2.5 Values and Locations [NEW]</span></h2>
<p><span class="add">A DWARF expression is evaluated in a context that determines whether
its result is expected to be a value or a location. Expressions that are
expected to produce a location are called “location descriptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="add">Values on the stack are typed, and can represent a value of any
supported base type of the target machine, or of the generic type, which
is an integral type that has the size of an address in the default
address space on the target machine, and unspecified signedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="add"><em>The generic type is the same as the unspecified type used for stack
operations defined in DWARF Version 4 and before.</em></span></p>
<p><span class="add"><em>Debugging information must provide consumers a way to
find the location of program variables, determine the bounds of dynamic
arrays and strings, and possibly to find the base address of a
subroutine’s stack frame or the return address of a subroutine.
Furthermore, to meet the needs of recent computer architectures and
optimization techniques, debugging information must be able to describe
the location of an object whose location changes over the object’s
lifetime.</em></span></p>
<p><span class="add">Information about the location of program objects is provided by
location descriptions and location lists.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">A <strong>location description</strong> is a DWARF expression yielding a
single location. These are sufficient for describing the
location of any object as long as its lifetime is either
static or the same as the lexical block that owns it,
excluding any prologue or epilogue ranges, and it does not
move during its lifetime. As the value of an attribute, a
location description is encoded using class <code>locdesc</code>.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">A <strong>location list</strong> describes objects that have a limited
lifetime or change their location during their lifetime. A
location list is a list of location descriptions, each
associated with a range of program counters. Location
lists are described in Section 3.18. As the value of an
attribute, a location list is encoded using class
<code>loclist</code> (which serves as an index into a separate
section containing location lists).</span></p>
<p><span class="add">A location list may have overlapping PC ranges, and thus
may yield more than one location. In these cases, the
object value stored in each location is expected to be the same
(except for uninitialized/undefined parts of the value).</span></p>
<p><span class="add"><em>A location list that yields multiple locations can be
used to describe objects that reside in more than one
piece of storage at the same time. An object may have more
than one location as a result of optimization. For
example, a value that is only read may be promoted from
memory to a register for some region of code, but later
code may revert to reading the value from memory as the
register may be used for other purposes.</em></span></p>
<p><span class="add">When given multiple locations, a consumer can read the
object’s value from any of those locations (since they all
refer to storage that should contain the same value), but must write
any changed value to all the locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">DWARF can describe the location of program objects in
several kinds of storage. The location identifies a
specific kind of storage, and provides a (zero-based) bit
offset relative to the start of that storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">A “storage bank” is a linear stream of bits of finite size.
The ordering of bits within a storage bank uses the bit
numbering and direction conventions that are appropriate
to the current language on the target architecture. An
offset must be greater than or equal to 0 and not larger
than the size (in bits) of the storage bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">DWARF can describe locations in four kinds of storage:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="add">Memory storage.
Corresponds to the target architecture memory address
spaces. The size of a memory storage bank is determined
by the size of the address space.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="add">Register storage.
Corresponds to the target architecture registers. Each
register is a separate storage bank, and the size of the
storage bank is the size of the register.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="add">Undefined storage.
Indicates no value is available and therefore cannot be
read or written. The size of an undefined storage bank
is the size of the largest address space or
register on the target architecture.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="add">Implicit storage.
Corresponds to fixed values that can only be read. The
size of an implicit storage bank is determined by the
type of the value or the size of the constant block used
to define the implicit storage, and is limited to the
size of the largest address space or register on the target
architecture.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="add">DWARF can also describe composite locations, a mixture of
the above kinds of storage, where some bits come from one
kind of storage and some from another, or from disjoint
parts of the same storage bank. The size of a composite
storage bank is the sum of the sizes of the composite parts,
and is limited to the size of the largest address space or
register on the target architecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">An implicit conversion between a memory location and a value may happen
during the execution of any operation or when evaluation of the
expression is completed. If a location is expected, but the result is
a value, the value is implicitly treated as a memory address in the
default address space, and converted to a memory location. If a value
is expected, but the result is an addressable memory
location (i.e., the offset is a multiple of the byte size)
in the default address space, the address is implicitly
converted to a value of the generic type.</span></p>
<h1>Chapter 3: DWARF Expressions</h1>
<p>DWARF expressions describe how to compute a value or
specify a location. They are expressed in
terms of DWARF operations that operate on a stack of <span class="del">values</span>
<span class="add">elements, each of which may be
either a value or a location.</span></p>
<p>A DWARF expression is encoded as a stream of operations,
each consisting of an opcode followed by zero or more literal
operands. The number of operands is implied by the opcode.</p>
<p><span class="del">In addition to the
general operations that are defined here, operations that are
specific to location descriptions are defined in
Section {locationdescriptions}.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">The result of a DWARF expression is the value or location on the top
of the stack after evaluating the operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">Values on the stack are typed, and can
represent a value of any supported base type of the target
machine, or of the generic type, which is an integral type
that has the size of an address in the default address space
on the target machine, and unspecified signedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="del"><em>The generic type is the same as the unspecified type used for stack
operations defined in DWARF Version 4 and before.</em></span></p>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.1</span> 3.1 DWARF Expression Evaluation Context</h2>
<p>DWARF expressions <span class="del">and location descriptions (see Section
{locationdescriptions})</span> are evaluated within a
context provided by the debugger or other DWARF consumer.
The context includes the following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Required result kind</p>
<p>The kind of result required – either a location or a value – is
determined by the DWARF construct where the expression is found.</p>
<p><em>For example, DWARF attributes with <code>exprval</code> class
require a value, and attributes with <code>locdesc</code> class require
a location <span class="del">description</span> (see Section {classesandforms}).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial stack</p>
<p>In most cases, the DWARF expression stack is empty at the start
of expression evaluation. In certain circumstances, however, one
or more values are pushed implicitly onto the stack before evaluation
of the expression starts (e.g., <code>DW_AT_data_member_location</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current compilation unit</p>
<p>The current compilation unit is the compilation unit debugging
information entry that contains the DWARF expression being evaluated.</p>
<p>A current compilation unit is required for operations that reference
debug information associated with the same compilation unit, including
indicating if such references use the 32-bit or 64-bit DWARF format.</p>
<p><em>For example, the <code>DW_OP_constx</code> and <code>DW_OP_addrx</code> operations
require the address size, which is a property of the compilation unit.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that this compilation unit might not be the same as the
compilation unit determined from the loaded code object corresponding
to the current program location. For example, the evaluation of the
expression E associated with a <code>DW_AT_location</code> attribute of the debug
information entry operand of the <code>DW_OP_call&lt;n&gt;</code> operations is evaluated
with the compilation unit that contains E and not the one that contains
the <code>DW_OP_call&lt;n&gt;</code> operation expression.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target architecture</p>
<p>The target architecture is typically provided by the object file
containing the DWARF information. It may also be refined by instruction
set identifiers in the line number table.</p>
<p>The target architecture is required for operations that specify
architecture-specific entities.</p>
<p><em>Architecture-specific entities include DWARF register identifiers,
DWARF address space identifiers, the default address space, and the
address space address sizes.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current thread</p>
<p><em>Many programming environments support the concept of independent
threads of execution, where the process and its address space are shared
among the threads, but each thread has its own stack, program counter,
and possibly its own block of memory for thread-local storage (TLS).
These threads may be implemented in user-space or with kernel threads,
or by a combination of the two.</em></p>
<p>The current thread identifies a current thread of execution. When
debugging a multi-threaded program, the current thread may be selected
by a user command that focuses on a specific thread, or it may be selected
automatically when the running thread stops at a breakpoint.</p>
<p><em>If there is no current process (or an image of a process, as from
a core file), there is no current thread.</em></p>
<p>A current thread is required for the <span class="del"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_address</code></span>
<span class="add"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_location</code></span> operation
(see Section {stackoperations}) which provides access to
thread-local storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current call frame</p>
<p>The current call frame identifies an active invocation of a subprogram.
It is identified by its address on the call stack (see Section
{framebase}). The address is referred to as the frame base
or the call frame address (CFA). The call frame information is used to
determine the base addresses for the call frames of the current thread’s
call stack (see Section {callframeinformation}).</p>
<p><em>When debugging a running program or examining a core file,
the current frame may be the topmost (most recently activated) frame
(e.g., where a breakpoint has triggered), or may be selected by a user
command to focus the view on a frame further down the call stack.
The current frame provides a view of the state of the running process
at a particular point in time.</em></p>
<p>The current call frame (if there is one) must be an active call frame
in the current call stack.</p>
<p>A current call frame is required for operations that use the contents
of registers (e.g., <code>DW_OP_reg&lt;n&gt;</code>) or frame-local storage (e.g., <code>DW_OP_fbreg</code>)
so that the debugger can retrieve values from the selected view of the
process state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current lane</p>
<p><em>On SIMD (Single-Instruction Multiple-Data Stream) and SIMT
(Single-Instruction Multiple-Thread) architectures, fine-grained parallel
execution can be achieved by dispatching a single instruction across
multiple data streams (e.g., a vector or array). Some parallel programming
models allow for the vectorization of loops using SIMD instructions.
These parallel streams can be considered fine-grain threads of execution,
or lanes, where all lanes typically share a common stack, program counter,
and register file.</em></p>
<p><em>In SIMT architectures, control flow may diverge through the use of
predication, where each instruction executes only in certain lanes. Some
SIMT architectures, however, provide separate stacks and register files
for each lane, and the parallel streams of execution may instead be
represented as threads (above).</em></p>
<p>The current lane is a SIMD/SIMT lane identifier. This applies to source
languages with scalar code that is vectorized by the compiler using a
SIMD/SIMT execution model. These implementations map vectorized operations
to SIMD/SIMT lanes of execution (see Section {lanesinsimdvectorization}).
When debugging a SIMD/SIMT program, the current lane is typically selected
by a user command that focuses on a specific lane.</p>
<p>The current lane number must be consistent with the value of the <code>DW_AT_num_lanes</code>
attribute of the subprogram corresponding to the current frame and program
location. It is consistent if the lane number is greater than or equal to 0 and
less than the, possibly default, value of the <code>DW_AT_num_lanes</code> attribute.</p>
<p>If the current program is not using a SIMD/SIMT execution model, the current
lane is always 0.</p>
<p>A current lane is required for the <code>DW_OP_push_lane</code> operation (see Section
{stackoperations}), which pushes the value of the current lane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current program counter (PC)</p>
<p>The current program counter (PC) identifies the current point of execution
in the current call frame.</p>
<p>The PC in each call frame is the address of the next instruction to be
executed in that frame. For the top (most recent) frame on the call stack,
this is where execution would resume; for frames lower on the stack, it
is where the callee will return. The call frame information is used to
obtain the value of the return address register to determine the PC of
the other call frames (see Section {callframeinformation}).</p>
<p>If there is no current frame, there is no current PC.</p>
<p>The current PC is used during the evaluation of value lists and location
lists to select from among multiple program location ranges.</p>
<p><em>When evaluating value lists and location lists when no current PC
is available, only default <span class="del">location descriptions</span>
<span class="add">value or location list entries</span> may be used.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current object</p>
<p>The current object is a data object described by a data object entry
(see Section {dataobjectentries}) that is being inspected.
When evaluating expressions that provide attribute values of a data object,
the containing debugging information entry is the current object. When
evaluating expressions that provide attribute values for a type (e.g.,
<code>DW_AT_data_location</code> for a <code>DW_TAG_member</code>), the current object is the data
object entry (if there is one) that referred to the type entry (e.g.,
via <code>DW_AT_type</code>).</p>
<p>A current object is required for the
<span class="del"><code>DW_OP_push_object_address</code></span>
<span class="add"><code>DW_OP_push_object_location</code></span>
(see Section {stackoperations}) operation and <span class="add">is
implicitly defined</span> by some attributes (e.g.,
<code>DW_AT_data_member_location</code> and <code>DW_AT_use_location</code>) where the
object’s location is provided as part of the initial stack.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A DWARF expression <span class="del">for a location description</span> may be able to be
evaluated without a thread, call frame, lane, program counter, or architecture
context element. For example, the location of a global variable may be able
to be evaluated without such context, while the location of local variables
in a stack frame cannot be evaluated without additional context.</em></p>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.2 General Operations [REMOVED]</span></h2>
<p><span class="del">Each general operation represents a postfix operation on
a simple stack machine.
Each element of the stack has a type and a value, and can represent
a value of any supported base type of the target machine.  Instead of
a base type, elements can have a generic type,
which is an integral type that has the
size of an address on the target machine and
unspecified signedness. The value on the top of the stack after “executing” the
DWARF expression is taken to be the result (the address of the object, the
value of the array bound, the length of a dynamic string,
the desired value itself, and so on).</span></p>
<p><span class="del"><em>The generic type is the same as the unspecified type used for stack operations
defined in DWARF Version 4 and before.</em></span></p>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.2.3</span> 3.2 Stack Operations</h2>
<p>The following
operations manipulate the DWARF stack,
<span class="add">and may
operate on both values and locations.</span>
Operations that index the stack assume that the top of the stack (most
recently added entry) has index 0.</p>
<p>Each entry on the stack <span class="del">has an associated type</span>
<span class="add">is either a value (with an associated type) or
a location</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_dup</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_dup</code> operation duplicates the <span class="del">value (including its
type identifier)</span>
<span class="add">entry</span> at the top of the stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_drop</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_drop</code> operation pops the <span class="del">value <span class="del">(including its type
identifier)</span></span><span class="add">entry</span> at the top of the stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_pick</code><br />
The single operand of the <code>DW_OP_pick</code> operation provides a
1-byte index. A copy of the stack entry <span class="del">(including its
type identifier)</span> with the specified
index (0 through 255, inclusive) is pushed onto the stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_over</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_over</code> operation duplicates the entry currently second
in the stack at the top of the stack.
This is equivalent to a
<code>DW_OP_pick</code> operation, with index 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_swap</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_swap</code> operation swaps the top two stack entries.
The entry at the top of the stack <span class="del">(including its type identifier)</span>
becomes the second stack entry, and the second entry <span class="del">(including
its type identifier)</span> becomes the top of the stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_rot</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_rot</code> operation rotates the first three stack
entries. The entry at the top of the stack <span class="del">(including its
type identifier)</span> becomes the third stack entry, the second
entry <span class="del">(including its type identifier)</span> becomes the top of
the stack, and the third entry <span class="del">(including its type identifier)</span>
becomes the second entry.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Examples illustrating many of these stack operations are
found in Appendix {dwarfstackoperationexamples}.</em></p>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.2.1</span> 3.3 Literal <span class="del">Encodings</span> <span class="add">and Constant Operations</span></h2>
<p>The following operations all push a value onto the DWARF stack.
Operations other than <code>DW_OP_const_type</code> push a value with the
generic type, and if the value of a constant in one of these
operations is larger than can be stored in a single stack element,
the value is truncated to the element size and the low-order bits
are pushed on the stack.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_lit0</code>, <code>DW_OP_lit1</code>, …, <code>DW_OP_lit31</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_lit&lt;n&gt;</code> operations encode the unsigned literal values
from 0 through 31, inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_const1u</code>, <code>DW_OP_const2u</code>, <code>DW_OP_const4u</code>, <code>DW_OP_const8u</code><br />
The single operand of a <code>DW_OP_const&lt;n&gt;u</code> operation provides a 1,
2, 4, or 8-byte unsigned integer constant, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_const1s</code>, <code>DW_OP_const2s</code>, <code>DW_OP_const4s</code>, <code>DW_OP_const8s</code><br />
The single operand of a <code>DW_OP_const&lt;n&gt;s</code> operation provides a 1,
2, 4, or 8-byte signed integer constant, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_constu</code><br />
The single operand of the <code>DW_OP_constu</code> operation provides
an unsigned LEB128 integer constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_consts</code><br />
The single operand of the <code>DW_OP_consts</code> operation provides
a signed LEB128 integer constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_constx</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_constx</code> operation has a single operand that
encodes an unsigned LEB128 value,
which is a zero-based
index into the <code>.debug_addr</code> section, where a constant, the
size of <span class="del">a machine address</span>
<span class="add">the generic type</span>, is stored.
This index is relative to the value of the
<code>DW_AT_addr_base</code> attribute of the associated compilation unit.</p>
<p><em>The <code>DW_OP_constx</code> operation is provided for constants that
require link-time relocation but should not be
interpreted by the consumer as a relocatable address
(for example, offsets to thread-local storage).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_const_type</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_const_type</code> operation takes three operands. The first operand
is an unsigned LEB128 integer that represents the offset of a debugging
information entry in the current compilation unit, which must be a
<code>DW_TAG_base_type</code> entry that provides the type of the constant provided. The
second operand is a 1-byte unsigned integer that specifies the size of the
constant value, which is the same as the size of the base type referenced
by the first operand. The third operand is a
sequence of bytes of the given size that is
interpreted as a value of the referenced type.</p>
<p><em>While the size of the constant can be inferred from the base type
definition, it is encoded explicitly into the operation so that the
operation can be parsed easily without reference to the <code>.debug_info</code>
section.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.2.2</span> 3.4 Register Value Operations</h2>
<p>The following operation pushes
<span class="del">a value onto the stack that is either part or all of</span>
the contents of a register <span class="del">or the result of adding the contents of a
register to a given signed offset</span> <span class="add">onto the stack</span>.
<span class="del"><code>DW_OP_regval_type</code> pushes the contents of a
register together with the given base type.
<code>DW_OP_regval_bits</code> pushes the partial contents of
a register together with the generic type.
The other operations
push the result of adding the contents of a register to a given
signed offset together with the generic type.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_regval_type</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_regval_type</code> operation
pushes
the contents of
a given register interpreted as a value of a given type. The first
operand is an unsigned LEB128 number,
which identifies a register whose contents is to
be pushed onto the stack. The second operand is an unsigned LEB128 number
that represents the offset of a debugging information entry in the current
compilation unit, which must be a <code>DW_TAG_base_type</code> entry that provides the
type of the value contained in the specified register.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="del"><code>DW_OP_regval_bits</code></span><br />
<span class="del">The <code>DW_OP_regval_bits</code> operation takes a single unsigned LEB128
integer operand, which gives the number of bits to read. This number must
be smaller or equal to the bit size of the generic type.  It pops
the top two stack elements and interprets the top element as an
unsigned bit offset from the least significant bit end and the
other as a register number identifying the register from which to
extract the value.  If the extracted value is smaller than the size
of the generic type, it is zero extended.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.2.4</span> 3.5 Arithmetic and Logical Operations</h2>
<p>The following provide arithmetic and logical operations.
Operands of an operation with two operands
must have the same type,
either the same base type or the generic type.
The result of the operation which is pushed back has the same type
as the type of the operand(s).</p>
<p><span class="del">If the type of the operands is the generic type,

<p>Operations other than <code>DW_OP_abs</code>,
<code>DW_OP_div</code>, <code>DW_OP_minus</code>, <code>DW_OP_mul</code>, <code>DW_OP_neg</code> and <code>DW_OP_plus</code>
require integral types of the operand (either integral base type
or the generic type).  Operations do not cause an exception
on overflow.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_abs</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_abs</code> operation pops the top stack entry, interprets
it as a signed value and pushes its absolute value. If the
absolute value cannot be represented, the result is undefined.</p>
</li>
<li>

The <code>DW_OP_and</code> operation pops the top two stack values, performs
a bitwise and operation on the two, and pushes the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_div</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_div</code> operation pops the top two stack values, divides the former second entry by
the former top of the stack using signed division, and pushes the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_minus</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_minus</code> operation pops the top two stack values, subtracts the former top of the
stack from the former second entry, and pushes the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_mod</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_mod</code> operation pops the top two stack values and pushes the result of the

</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_mul</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_mul</code> operation pops the top two stack entries, multiplies them together, and
pushes the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_neg</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_neg</code> operation pops the top stack entry, interprets
it as a signed value and pushes its negation. If the negation
cannot be represented, the result is undefined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_not</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_not</code> operation pops the top stack entry, and pushes
its bitwise complement.</p>
</li>
<li>

The <code>DW_OP_or</code> operation pops the top two stack entries, performs
a bitwise or operation on the two, and pushes the result.</p>

<p><code>DW_OP_plusuconst</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_plusuconst</code> operation pops the top stack entry,
adds it to the unsigned LEB128constant operand
interpreted as the same type as the operand popped from the
top of the stack and pushes the result.</p>
<p><em>This operation is supplied specifically to be
able to encode more field offsets in two bytes than can be
done with
“<code>DW_OP_lit&lt;n&gt; DW_OP_plus</code>”.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_shl</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_shl</code> operation pops the top two stack entries,
shifts the former second entry left (filling with zero bits)
by the number of bits specified by the former top of the stack,
and pushes the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_shr</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_shr</code> operation pops the top two stack entries,
shifts the former second entry right logically (filling with
zero bits) by the number of bits specified by the former top
of the stack, and pushes the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_shra</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_shra</code> operation pops the top two stack entries,
shifts the former second entry right arithmetically (divide
the magnitude by 2, keep the same sign for the result) by
the number of bits specified by the former top of the stack,
and pushes the result.</p>
</li>

<h2><span class="add">3.6 Context Query Operations</span></h2>
<p><span class="add">The following operations can be used to push a value

<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="del"><code>DW_OP_push_object_address</code></span> <span class="add"><code>DW_OP_push_object_location</code></span><br />
<span class="del">The <code>DW_OP_push_object_address</code> operation pushes the
address of the object currently being evaluated as part of
evaluation of a user presented expression (see Section
{dwarfexpressionevaluationcontext}). This object may correspond to
an independent variable described by its own debugging information
entry or it may be a component of an array, structure, or class
whose address has been dynamically determined by an earlier step
during user expression evaluation.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">The <code>DW_OP_push_object_location</code> operation pushes the location of the

<p><span class="add"><em>This object may correspond to an independent
variable described by its own debugging information entry; or it may be a
component of an array, structure, or class whose address has been

evaluation.</em></span></p>
<p><em>This operator provides explicit functionality (especially for
arrays involving descriptors) that is analogous to the implicit push
of the base address of a structure prior to evaluation of a
<code>DW_AT_data_member_location</code> to access a data member of a structure. For
an example, see Appendix D.2.</em></p>
<p><span class="add"><em>In previous versions of DWARF, this operator was named <code>DW_OP_push_object_address</code>.

</li>
<li>
<p><span class="del"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_address</code></span> <span class="add"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_location</code></span><br />
The <span class="del"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_address</code></span>
<span class="add"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_location</code></span>
operation pops a value from the stack,
which must have an integral type <span class="del">identifier</span>,
translates this value into
<span class="del">an address</span> <span class="add">a location</span>
in the thread-local storage for the current thread
(see Section 3.1), and pushes the
<span class="del">address</span> <span class="add">location</span>
onto the stack <span class="del">together with the generic type identifier</span>.
The meaning of the value on the top of the stack prior to this
operation is defined by the run-time environment.  If the run-time
environment supports multiple thread-local storage blocks for a
single thread, then the block corresponding to the executable or
shared library containing this DWARF expression is used.</p>
<p><em>Some implementations of C, C++, Fortran, and other languages,
support a thread-local storage class. Variables with this storage
class have distinct values and addresses in distinct threads, much
as automatic variables have distinct values and addresses in each
function invocation. Typically, there is a single block of storage
containing all thread-local variables declared in the main
executable, and a separate block for the variables declared in each
shared library. Each thread-local variable can then be accessed in
its block using an identifier. This identifier is typically an
offset into the block and pushed onto the DWARF stack by one of the
<code>DW_OP_const&lt;n&gt;&lt;x&gt;</code> operations prior to the
<span class="del"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_address</code></span>
<span class="add"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_location</code></span>
operation. Computing the address of the appropriate block can be
complex (in some cases, the compiler emits a function call to do
it), and difficult to describe using ordinary DWARF location
descriptions. Instead of forcing complex thread-local storage
calculations into the DWARF expressions, the
<span class="del"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_address</code></span>
<span class="add"><code>DW_OP_form_tls_location</code></span>
allows the consumer to perform the computation based on the run-time

<p><code>DW_OP_call_frame_cfa</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_call_frame_cfa</code> operation pushes the value of the
current call frame address (CFA),
obtained from the Call Frame Information
(see Section {dwarfexpressionevaluationcontext} and
Section {callframeinformation}).</p>
<p><em>Although the value of <code>DW_AT_frame_base</code>
can be computed using other DWARF expression operators,
in some cases this would require an extensive location list
because the values of the registers used in computing the
CFA change during a subroutine. If the

is present, then it already encodes such changes, and it is
space efficient to reference that.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_push_lane</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_push_lane</code> operation pushes a lane index value
of the generic type, which provides the context of the lane in

or is computed from other locations and values in the program.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_implicit_value</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_implicit_value</code> operation specifies an immediate value
using two operands: an unsigned LEB128 length, followed by a
sequence of bytes of the given length that contain the value.
<span class="add">A location is formed for an implicit

</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_stack_value</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_stack_value</code>
operation specifies that the object
does not exist in memory but its value is nonetheless known
and is at the top of the DWARF expression stack. <span class="del">In this form
of location description, the DWARF expression represents the
actual value of the object, rather than its location.

<span class="add">A location is pushed on the stack for an implicit storage
bank containing the value represented using the encoding and byte order of

</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_implicit_pointer</code><br />
<em>An optimizing compiler may eliminate a pointer, while
still retaining the value that the pointer addressed.
<code>DW_OP_implicit_pointer</code> allows a producer to describe
<span class="del">this</span> <span class="add">the latter</span> value.</em></p>
<p>The <code>DW_OP_implicit_pointer</code> operation specifies that the object
is a pointer that cannot be represented as a real pointer,
even though the value it would point to can be described. In
this form of location <span class="del">description</span>, the DWARF expression refers
to a debugging information entry that represents the actual
value of the object to which the pointer would point. Thus, a
consumer of the debug information would be able to show the
value of the dereferenced pointer, even when it cannot show
the value of the pointer itself.</p>
<p>The <code>DW_OP_implicit_pointer</code> operation has two operands: a
reference to a debugging information entry <span class="add"><code>D</code></span> that describes
the dereferenced object’s value, and a signed number that
is treated as a byte offset <span class="add"><code>B</code></span> from the start of that value.
The first operand is a 4-byte unsigned value in the 32-bit
DWARF format, or an 8-byte unsigned value in the 64-bit
DWARF format (see Section {32bitand64bitdwarfformats})
that is used as the offset of a debugging information entry <span class="add"><code>D</code></span>
in the <code>.debug_info</code> section of the current executable
or shared object file.
The second operand, <span class="add"><code>B</code>,</span> is a

<p><span class="add">An implicit storage location <code>LP</code> is created for the
location of the pointer object <code>P</code>, and the location <code>LV</code> of
the object <code>V</code> is obtained from <code>D</code>. <code>LP</code> describes the
location of <code>P</code>, with an offset of 0, and the value in that
implicit storage represents (implicitly) the value of the
pointer, which is meant to point to <code>V</code>. <code>LV</code> describes the
location of the object <code>V</code>, with a byte offset of <code>B</code>.
</span></p>
<p><span class="add">The location <code>LP</code> is pushed onto the stack.</span></p>
<p><em>The debugging information entry <span class="add"><code>D</code></span> referenced by a
<code>DW_OP_implicit_pointer</code> operation is typically a
<code>DW_TAG_variable</code> or <code>DW_TAG_formal_parameter</code> entry whose
<code>DW_AT_location</code> attribute gives a second DWARF expression or a
location list that describes the value of the object, but the
referenced entry may be any entry that contains a <code>DW_AT_location</code>
or <code>DW_AT_const_value</code> attribute (for example, <code>DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure</code>).
By using the second DWARF expression, a consumer can
reconstruct the value of the object when asked to dereference
the pointer described by the original DWARF expression
containing the <code>DW_OP_implicit_pointer</code> operation.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>DWARF location descriptions are intended to yield the <strong>location</strong> of a

<h2><span class="del">2.6.1.2</span> 3.11 Composite Locations</h2>
<p><span class="del">A composite location description describes an object or
value which may be contained in part of a register or stored

more composition operations in a single composite location
description.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">A composite location description describes the location an object or

</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_piece</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_piece</code> operation takes a
single operand, which is an

<p><code>DW_OP_bit_piece</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_bit_piece</code> operation takes two operands.

If the location <span class="del">description</span> is

the <code>DW_OP_bit_piece</code> operation describes a
sequence of bits relative to the location whose address is
on the top of the DWARF stack using the bit numbering and
direction conventions that are appropriate to the current
language on the target system.
In all other cases, the source of the piece is given by either a
register location (see Section {registerlocationdescriptions}) or an
implicit value <span class="del">description</span> <span class="add">location</span>
(see Section {implicitlocationdescriptions});
the offset is from the least significant bit of the source value.</p>
<p><em><code>DW_OP_bit_piece</code> is

Each operation defines the number of bytes or bits to be loaded.</span></p>
<p><span class="add">Dereferencing a memory location simply loads a value from memory.
Dereferencing a register location extracts all or some of the bits from the register,

<span class="del">The <code>DW_OP_deref</code> operation pops the top stack entry and

In the <code>DW_OP_deref_size</code> operation, however, the size in bytes
of the data retrieved from the dereferenced address is

<p><code>DW_OP_deref_type</code><br />
<span class="del">The <code>DW_OP_deref_type</code> operation behaves like the <code>DW_OP_deref_size</code> operation:

In the <code>DW_OP_deref_type</code> operation, the size in

<p><code>DW_OP_xderef</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_xderef</code> operation provides an extended dereference
mechanism. The entry at the top of the stack is treated as an
address. The second stack entry is treated as an “address
space identifier” for those architectures that support
multiple
address spaces.

the size in bytes of the data retrieved from the
dereferenced
address is specified by the single operand. This operand is a
1-byte unsigned integral constant whose value may not be larger

<h2><span class="del">2.5.2.5</span> 3.14 Control Flow Operations</h2>
<p>The following operations provide simple control of the flow of a DWARF expression.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_le</code>, <code>DW_OP_ge</code>, <code>DW_OP_eq</code>, <code>DW_OP_lt</code>, <code>DW_OP_gt</code>, <code>DW_OP_ne</code><br />
The six relational operators each:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>pop the top two stack values, which have the same type,
either the same base type or the generic type,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compare the operands:<br />
<code>&lt;former second entry&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;relational operator&gt;</code> <code>&lt;former top entry&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>push the constant value 1 onto the stack
if the result of the operation is true or the
constant value 0 if the result of the operation is false.
The pushed value has the generic type.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the operands have the generic type, the comparisons
are performed as signed operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_skip</code><br />
<code>DW_OP_skip</code> is an unconditional branch. Its single operand
is a 2-byte signed integer constant. The 2-byte constant is
the number of bytes of the DWARF expression to skip forward
or backward from the current operation, beginning after the
2-byte constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_bra</code><br />
<code>DW_OP_bra</code> is a conditional branch. Its single operand is a
2-byte signed integer constant.  This operation pops the
top of stack. If the value popped is not <span class="del">the constant</span> 0,
the <span class="del">2-byte</span> constant operand is the number of bytes of the
DWARF expression to skip forward or backward from the current
operation, beginning after the 2-byte constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_call2</code>, <code>DW_OP_call4</code>, <code>DW_OP_call_ref</code><br />
<code>DW_OP_call2</code>, <code>DW_OP_call4</code>, and <code>DW_OP_call_ref</code> perform
DWARF procedure calls during evaluation of a DWARF expression or
location description.
For <code>DW_OP_call2</code> and <code>DW_OP_call4</code>,
the operand is the 2- or 4-byte unsigned offset, respectively,
of a debugging information entry in the current compilation
unit. The <code>DW_OP_call_ref</code> operator has a single operand. In the
32-bit DWARF format,
the operand is a 4-byte unsigned value;
in the 64-bit DWARF format, it is an 8-byte unsigned value
(see Section {32bitand64bitdwarfformats}).
The operand is used as the offset of a
debugging information entry in
the <code>.debug_info</code> section of the current executable or shared object file.</p>
<p><em>Operand interpretation of
<code>DW_OP_call2</code>, <code>DW_OP_call4</code> and <code>DW_OP_call_ref</code> is exactly like
that for <code>DW_FORM_ref2</code>, <code>DW_FORM_ref4</code> and <code>DW_FORM_ref_addr</code>,
respectively (see Section {attributeencodings}).</em></p>
<p>These operations transfer control of DWARF expression evaluation to
the <code>DW_AT_location</code> attribute of the referenced debugging information entry. If
there is no such attribute, then there is no effect. Execution
of the DWARF expression of a <code>DW_AT_location</code> attribute may
<span class="del">add to and/or remove from values on</span>
<span class="add">pop elements from the stack and/or push values or locations onto</span>
the stack.
Execution returns
to the point following the call when the end of the attribute
is reached. Values <span class="add">and locations</span> on the stack at the time of the call may be
used as parameters by the called expression, and <span class="del">values</span>
<span class="add">elements (values or locations)</span> left on
the stack by the called expression may be used as return values
by prior agreement between the calling and called expressions.</p>

</ol>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.2.6</span> 3.15 Type Conversions</h2>
<p>The following operations provide for explicit type conversion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_convert</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_convert</code> operation pops the top stack entry, converts it to a
different type, then pushes the result. It takes one operand, which is an
unsigned LEB128 integer that represents the offset of a debugging
information entry in the current compilation unit, or value 0 which
represents the generic type. If the operand is non-zero, the
referenced entry must be a <code>DW_TAG_base_type</code> entry that provides the type
to which the value is converted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_reinterpret</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_reinterpret</code> operation pops the top stack entry, reinterprets
the bits in its value as a value of a different type, then pushes the
result. It takes one operand, which is an unsigned LEB128 integer that
represents the offset of a debugging information entry in the current
compilation unit, or value 0 which represents the generic type.
If the operand is non-zero, the referenced entry must be a
<code>DW_TAG_base_type</code> entry that provides the type to which the value is
<span class="del">converted</span> <span class="add">reinterpreted</span>.
The type of the operand and result type must have the same size in bits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span class="del">2.5.2.7</span> 3.16 Special Operations</h2>
<p>There are these special operations currently defined:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_nop</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_nop</code> operation is a place holder. It has no effect
on the <span class="del">location</span> stack or any of its
<span class="del">values</span> <span class="add">elements</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_entry_value</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_entry_value</code> operation pushes
the value that
an expression would have had, or a register location would have held,
upon entering the current subprogram.  It has two operands: an
unsigned LEB128 length, followed by
a block containing a DWARF expression or a register location description
(see Section {registerlocationdescriptions}).
The length operand specifies the length in bytes of the block.
If the block contains a DWARF expression,
the DWARF expression is evaluated as if it had been evaluated upon entering
the current subprogram.  The DWARF expression
assumes no values are present on the DWARF stack initially and results
in exactly one value being pushed on the DWARF stack when completed.
If the block contains a register location
description, <code>DW_OP_entry_value</code> pushes the value that register
held
upon entering the current subprogram.</p>
<p><span class="del"><code>DW_OP_push_object_address</code></span>
<span class="add"><code>DW_OP_push_object_location</code></span>
is not meaningful inside of this DWARF operation.</p>
<p><em>The register location description provides a more compact form for the
case where the value was in a register on entry to the subprogram.</em></p>
<p><em>The values needed to evaluate <code>DW_OP_entry_value</code> could be obtained in
several ways. The consumer could suspend execution on entry to the
subprogram, record values needed by <code>DW_OP_entry_value</code> expressions within
the subprogram, and then continue; when evaluating <code>DW_OP_entry_value</code>,
the consumer would use these recorded values rather than the current
values.  Or, when evaluating <code>DW_OP_entry_value</code>, the consumer could
virtually unwind using the Call Frame Information
(see Section {callframeinformation})
to recover register values that might have been clobbered since the
subprogram entry point.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_extended</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_extended</code> opcode encodes an extension operation. It has
at least one operand: a ULEB128 constant identifying the extension operation.
The remaining operands are defined by the extension opcode, which are named
using a prefix of <code>DW_OP_</code>.
The extension opcode 0 is reserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_OP_user_extended</code><br />
The <code>DW_OP_user_extended</code> opcode encodes a
producer
extension operation.
It has at least one operand: a ULEB128 constant identifying a
producer
extension operation. The remaining operands are defined by the
producer
extension. The
producer
extension opcode 0 is reserved and cannot be used by any
producer
extension.</p>
<p><em>The <code>DW_OP_user_extended</code> encoding space can be understood to supplement
the space defined by <code>DW_OP_lo_user</code> and <code>DW_OP_hi_user</code> that is allocated by

<h2><span class="del">2.5.2</span> 3.17 Value Lists</h2>
<p>Value lists are used in place of
DWARF expressions whenever the value of an object’s attribute
can change during the lifetime of that object.</p>
<p>Value lists are contained in a separate object file section,
along with location lists (see {locationlists}).</p>
<p>A value list is indicated by an attribute whose value is of class
<code>vallist</code> (see Section {classesandforms}).</p>
<p>A value list consists of a series of value list entries.
The representation of a value list is the same as for a
location list (see {locationlists}), except
that bounded location description and default location description
entries are understood to provide DWARF expressions that produce
values rather than location descriptions.</p>
<p><span class="del"><em>The DWARF expressions in value list entries, being
expressions and not location descriptions, may not contain
any of the DWARF operations described in Section
{locationdescriptions}.</em></span></p>
<p>The address ranges defined by the bounded expressions of a
value list may overlap. When they do, the meaning is undefined
if the overlapping expressions do not produce the same value.</p>
<h2><span class="del">2.6.2</span> 3.18 Location Lists</h2>
<p>Location lists are used <span class="del">in place of</span>
<span class="add">as</span> location descriptions whenever
the object whose location is being described can change location
during its lifetime.
Location lists are contained in a separate
object file section called <code>.debug_loclists</code> or <code>.debug_loclists.dwo</code>
(for split DWARF object files).</p>
<p>A location list is indicated by <span class="del">a location or other</span>
<span class="add">an</span> attribute whose value is of class <code>loclist</code>
(see Section {classesandforms}).</p>
<p><span class="del"><em>This location list representation, the <code>loclist</code> class, and the
related <code>DW_AT_loclists_base</code> attribute are new in DWARF Version 5.
Together they eliminate most or all of the object language relocations
previously needed for location lists.</em></span></p>
<p>A location list consists of a series of location list entries.
Each location list entry is one of the following kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bounded location description.</p>
<p>This kind of entry provides a
location description that specifies the location of
an object that is valid over a lifetime bounded
by a starting and ending address. The starting address is the
lowest address of the address range over which the location
is valid. The ending address is the address of the first
location past the highest address of the address range.
When the current PC is within the given range, the location
description may be used to locate the specified object.
The location description is valid even if the address range
includes addresses within a prologue or epilogue range.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of bounded location description
entries which differ in the way that they specify the
starting and ending addresses.</p>
<p>The address ranges defined by the bounded location descriptions
of a location list may overlap. When they do, they describe a
situation in which an object exists simultaneously in more than
one place. If all of the address ranges in a given location
list do not collectively cover the entire range over which the
object in question is defined, and there is no following default
location description, it is assumed that the object is not
available for the portion of the range that is not covered.</p>
<p>In the case of a bounded location description where the range is defined
by a starting address and either an ending address or a length, a
starting address consisting of the reserved address value (see Section
{reservedtargetaddress}) indicates a non-existent range,
which is equivalent to omitting the description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Default location description.
This kind of entry provides a
location description that specifies the location of
an object that is valid when no bounded location description
applies.
As with simple location descriptions, the lifetime of a default
location excludes any prologue or epilogue ranges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base address.
This kind of entry provides an address to be
used as the base address for beginning and ending address
offsets given in certain kinds of bounded location description.
The applicable base address of a bounded location description
entry is the address specified by the closest preceding base
address entry in the same location list. If there is no
preceding base address entry, then the applicable base address
defaults to the base address of the compilation unit (see
Section {fullandpartialcompilationunitentries}).</p>
<p>In the case of a compilation unit where all of the machine
code is contained in a single contiguous section, no base
address entry is needed.</p>
<p>If the base address is the reserved target address, either explicitly
or by default, then the range of any bounded location description
defined relative to that base address is non-existent, which is
equivalent to omitting the description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-of-list.
This kind of entry marks the end of the location list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A location list consists of a sequence of zero or more bounded
location description or base address entries, optionally followed
by a default location entry, and terminated by an end-of-list
entry.</p>
<p>If there is no current PC (see Section
{dwarfexpressionevaluationcontext}), only the
default location list entry is used.</p>
<p>Each location list entry begins with a single byte identifying
the kind of that entry, followed by zero or more operands depending
on the kind.</p>
<p>In the descriptions that follow, these terms are used for operands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A counted location description operand consists of
an unsigned ULEB integer giving the length of the location
description (see Section {singlelocationdescriptions})
that immediately follows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An address index operand is the index of an address
in the <code>.debug_addr</code> section. This index is relative to the
value of the <code>DW_AT_addr_base</code> attribute of the associated
compilation unit. The address given by this kind
of operand is not relative to the compilation unit base address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A target address operand is an address on the target
machine. (Its size is the same as used for attribute values of
class <code>address</code>, specifically, <code>DW_FORM_addr</code>.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following entry kinds are defined for use in both
split or non-split units:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_end_of_list</code><br />
An end-of-list entry contains no further data.</p>
<p><em>A series of this kind of entry may be used for padding or
alignment purposes.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_base_addressx</code><br />
This is a form of base address entry that has one unsigned
LEB128 operand. The operand value is an address index (into the
<code>.debug_addr</code> section) that indicates the applicable base address
used by subsequent <code>DW_LLE_offset_pair</code> entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_startx_endx</code><br />
This is a form of bounded location description entry
(see page {bndlocdesc})
that has two unsigned LEB128 operands. The operand values are
address indices (into the <code>.debug_addr</code> section). These indicate the
starting and ending addresses, respectively, that define
the address range for which this location is valid.
These operands are followed by a counted location description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_startx_length</code><br />
This is a form of bounded location description entry
(see page {bndlocdesc})
that has two unsigned LEB128 operands. The first value is an address index
(into the <code>.debug_addr</code> section)
that indicates the beginning of the address range over
which the location is valid.
The second value is the length of the range.
These operands are followed by a counted location description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_offset_pair</code><br />
This is a form of {bounded location description} entry
(see page {bndlocdesc})
that has two unsigned LEB128 operands. The values of these
operands are the starting and ending offsets, respectively,
relative to the applicable base address, that define the
address range for which this location is valid.
These operands are followed by a counted location description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_default_location</code><br />
The operand is a counted location description which defines
where an object is located if no prior location description
is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_include_loclistx</code><br />
This is a form of list inclusion, that has one unsigned LEB128
operand.  The value is an index into the <code>.debug_loclists</code> section,
interpreted the same way as the operand of <code>DW_FORM_loclistx</code> to find
a target list of entries, which will be regarded as part of the
current location list, up to the <code>DW_LLE_end_of_list</code> entry.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following kinds of location list entries are defined for
use only in non-split DWARF units:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_base_address</code><br />
A base address entry has one target address operand.
This address is used as the base address when interpreting
offsets in subsequent location list entries of kind
<code>DW_LLE_offset_pair</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_start_end</code><br />
This is a form of bounded location description entry
(see page {bndlocdesc})
that has two target address operands. These indicate the
starting and ending addresses, respectively, that define
the address range for which the location is valid.
These operands are followed by a counted location description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_start_length</code><br />
This is a form of bounded location description entry
(see page {bndlocdesc})
that has one target address operand value and an unsigned LEB128
integer operand value. The address is the beginning address
of the range over which the location description is valid, and
the length is the number of bytes in that range.
These operands are followed by a counted location description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DW_LLE_include_loclist</code><br />
This is a form of list inclusion, that has one offset operand.  The
value is an offset into the <code>.debug_loclists</code> section, like the
operand of <code>DW_FORM_sec_offset</code>.  The offset identifies the
first entry of a location list whose entries are to be regarded as part of
the current location  list, up to the <code>DW_LLE_end_of_list</code> entry.</p>

<p>For a <code>DW_AT_data_member_location</code> attribute there are two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the value is an integer constant, it is the offset in bytes from the beginning
of the containing entity. If the beginning of the containing entity has a
non-zero bit offset then the beginning of the member entry has that same bit
offset as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the value must be a location description. <span class="del">In this case, the
beginning of the containing entity must be byte aligned.</span> The <span class="del">beginning
address</span> <span class="add">location of the containing entity</span> is pushed on the DWARF stack before the location description is
evaluated; the result of the evaluation is the <span class="del">base address</span> <span class="add">location</span> of the member
entry (see Section 2.5.1 on page 27).</p>
<p><em>The push on the DWARF expression stack of the <span class="del">base address</span> <span class="add">location</span> of the containing

two values to be pushed onto the DWARF expression stack before the
<code>DW_AT_use_location</code> description is evaluated (see Section <span class="del">2.5.1</span><span class="add">3.1</span>). The
first value pushed is the value of the pointer to member object itself. The second
