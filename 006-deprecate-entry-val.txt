Part 5: Deprecate DW_OP_entry_value

In Section 2.5.1.7 Special Operations, mark DW_OP_entry_value as
deprecated, and add the following non-normative text at the end of the
description of DW_OP_entry_value:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    [non-normative] The DW_OP_entry_value operation is deprecated as its
    main usage is provided by other means. DWARF Version 5 added the
    DW_TAG_call_site_parameter debugger information entry for call sites
    that has DW_AT_call_value, DW_AT_call_data_location, and
    DW_AT_call_data_value attributes that provide DWARF expressions to
    compute actual parameter values at the time of the call, and
    requires the producer to ensure the expressions are valid to
    evaluate even when virtually unwound.
